You are a senior full-stack web engineer and security-conscious system architect.

Your task is to design and scaffold an MVP web application called “Proof of Trend” ($POT).

This is a production-grade MVP. Prioritize:
- Correctness
- Clean architecture
- Security by default
- Efficiency and scalability
- Separation of concerns
- Future proprietary data protection

DO NOT generate placeholder spaghetti code.
DO NOT hardcode secrets.
DO NOT mix frontend and backend logic improperly.

---

## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW

Proof of Trend is a web platform that provides:
1) Proof of Trend – early trend discovery
2) Proof of Price – historical pricing intelligence
3) Proof of Execution – verifiable execution logging (light MVP version)

Blockchain (Algorand) is used ONLY for:
- Hash anchoring
- Timestamp verification
- Wallet identity

No financial guarantees.
No revenue claims.
No custodial behavior.

---

## 2. TECH STACK (STRICT)

Frontend:
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

Backend:
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- REST API (not GraphQL for MVP)
- Prisma ORM

Database:
- PostgreSQL
- Time-series friendly schema

Blockchain:
- Algorand (hash anchoring only)
- Wallet connect (read-only MVP)

Auth:
- Email + wallet address
- JWT access tokens
- Role-based access control

AI:
- API-based abstraction layer
- NO direct vendor lock-in
- All AI calls must be isolated in services

---

## 3. CORE ARCHITECTURE RULES

- Frontend must NEVER talk directly to the database
- Backend API must validate ALL inputs
- All writes must be authenticated
- All sensitive logic must live server-side
- Hashes are stored on-chain, raw data is NOT
- No proprietary trend data is exposed via public endpoints

Use:
- Service layer
- Controller layer
- Data access layer
- Utility layer

---

## 4. DATABASE MODELS (MVP ONLY)

Design Prisma models for:

### User
- id
- email
- walletAddress (optional)
- role (user | admin)
- createdAt

### Trend
- id
- name
- category
- description
- trendScore
- detectedAt
- createdAt

### TrendHash
- id
- trendId
- hash
- blockchainTxId
- timestamp

### PriceSnapshot
- id
- trendId
- source
- price
- recordedAt

### ExecutionLog
- id
- userId
- trendId
- executionType
- referenceUrl (optional)
- createdAt

All models must include:
- Indexes where appropriate
- Foreign key constraints
- Soft-deletion readiness

---

## 5. API ENDPOINTS (REQUIRED)

Implement REST endpoints with validation:

### Trends
- GET /api/trends
- GET /api/trends/:id
- POST /api/trends (admin only)

### Price Intelligence
- GET /api/trends/:id/prices

### Execution
- POST /api/executions
- GET /api/users/:id/executions

### Auth
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/logout
- GET /api/auth/me

All endpoints must:
- Validate input
- Sanitize output
- Enforce auth rules
- Return consistent response formats

---

## 6. FRONTEND PAGES (ALL MUST CONNECT)

Implement the following pages and ensure navigation works:

1. Homepage
   - Explains Proof of Trend / Price / Execution
   - CTA to dashboard

2. Trend Dashboard
   - List trends
   - Filters
   - Trend score visualization

3. Trend Detail Page
   - Trend metadata
   - Price chart
   - Execution CTA

4. Execution Modal / Page
   - Submit execution log
   - Client-side validation
   - Server-side verification

5. User Profile
   - Execution history
   - Connected wallet status

6. Pricing Page
   - Free vs Pro
   - $POT utility explanation

---

## 7. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

- Use environment variables for secrets
- Rate-limit all POST endpoints
- Protect against:
  - SQL injection
  - XSS
  - CSRF
- No wallet signing required in MVP
- No raw blockchain private keys stored
- Use server-side hashing utilities

---

## 8. PERFORMANCE & MAINTAINABILITY

- Use async/await correctly
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Cache read-heavy endpoints
- Write reusable components
- Write readable, commented code

---

## 9. WHAT TO OUTPUT

Generate:
- Folder structure
- Prisma schema
- API route handlers
- Frontend pages
- Utility services
- Basic UI components
- Clear TODO comments for post-MVP features

DO NOT:
- Overbuild governance
- Add staking logic
- Add ad marketplace
- Add financial promises

This MVP must be:
- Stable
- Understandable
- Extendable

Begin by scaffolding the project structure and Prisma schema first.
